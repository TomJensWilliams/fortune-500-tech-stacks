## Walmart
	An article that can be found [here](https://medium.com/@NiveR05/walmart-tech-stack-a328a8606e1b) seems to imply that React and Node.js are both important parts of Walmart's tech stack. It also notes Walmart Labs' creation of Electrode, which is ["a platform for building universal React/Node.js applications with standardized structure, best practices, and modern technologies baked in."](https://www.electrode.io/) Besided these they also use a laundry list of other technologies.

 ## Amazon
 	(This) article claims that Amazon is built on Linux, and relies most heavily on Java and Python, but also makes use of C++ and Ruby. Another article, found [here](https://appscrip.com/blog/amazon-marketplace-tech-stack-and-infrastructure/) claims that along with the usual HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, that Amazon uses React for the front end, and that on the back end they use Java, MySQL, and Amazon S3, which is a clod-based storage solution they offer through AWS. Other articles generally make similar claims, and it seems like Amazon also uses Node.js, PostgreSQL, and various other technologies.
